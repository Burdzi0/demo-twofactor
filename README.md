# Demo Two Factor Application

This is a demo Spring Boot application to illustrate implementing multi-stage logins with two factor authentication.

## Seeding User Information
User information can be seeded by modifying the `data.sql` file.

## Starting
In order to start the Spring Boot application you will need to run the `gradle bootRun` task.

# Disclaimer
This application should not be used in a production environment.  It does not contain any adequate security and stores passwords in plain-text format.

It should only be used as an idea of how one might go about implementing two factor authentication.
